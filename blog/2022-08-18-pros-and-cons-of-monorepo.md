## Introduction 
There are many different ways to manage source code repositories. Some developers prefer to keep all of their code in a single large repository (a "mono-repo"), while others prefer to break their codebase into multiple smaller repositories (a "multi-repo" strategy). Each approach has its own pros and cons, which we will explore in this article.

## Advantages of a Mono-Repo

**Simplicity**: A mono-repo is much simpler to manage than a multi-repo setup. There is only one codebase to worry about, and all of the code is stored in the same place. This can make it easier for developers to find the code they are looking for, and it can also make it easier to track changes across the entire codebase.

**Easier to Coordinate Changes:** If you have multiple teams working on different parts of the same codebase, a mono-repo can make it easier to coordinate changes. Since all of the code is stored in the same place, it is easy to see what changes are being made by other teams, and to merge those changes into your own code.

**Easier to Share Code:** A mono-repo can also make it easier to share code between different parts of the codebase. If you have a common library that is used by multiple components, it is easy to keep that library in the mono-repo and make sure that all of the components are using the same version.

## Disadvantages of a Mono-Repo

**Size:** A mono-repo can quickly become very large, and it can be difficult to keep track of all of the code. This can make it difficult for developers to find the code they are looking for, and it can also make it difficult to run automated tools on the codebase.

**Compatibility Issues:** If you have multiple teams working on different parts of the same codebase, you may need to coordinate changes carefully to avoid compatibility issues. For example, if one team makes a change that breaks the build for another team, that team will need to make a change to their code to fix the problem.

**Increased Build Times:** A mono-repo can also lead to increased build times, since all of the code needs to be built every time a change is made. This can be a particular problem if you have a large codebase, or if you have a lot of dependencies between different parts of the code.

## Conclusion 

So, which is better? Mono-repo or multi-repo? There is no easy answer, and the best solution will vary depending on your specific needs. If you have a small codebase, or if you only have a few teams working on the code, a mono-repo may be the best option. If you have a large codebase, or if you have multiple teams working on different parts of the code, a multi-repo strategy may be a better option.
